Whys, How tos & hows
====================

Why?
----

Readthedocs compiles documentation from one repository only. We have many.
So this repository clones other repositories defined in sources/.repos and lets you have documentation from a number of (public) repositories.

How to: PHP API documentation generator
---------------------------------------

``composer global require "sphpdox/sphpdox:dev-master"``

``composer update``

``cd ~/.composer/vendor/sphpdox/sphpdox/``

``./sphpdox.php process -o ~/myOutputDir  'My\Name\Space' ~/myProjectSource/``


How to setup your repo documentation structure?
-----------------------------------------------

Use ``{ProjectRoot}\Resources\doc\`` for human documentation. Please have a ``index.rst`` with something like this inside:

::

    Your project name
    =================

    Contents:

    .. toctree::
            :maxdepth: 150
            :titlesonly:
            :glob:

            somethingSomething/important*
            *

Use ``{ProjectRoot}\Resources\API\`` for autogenerated API documentation.

Only these two directories will be retrieved and processed.

Usage
-----

Add git repositories to sources/.repos file.
Publish it on github, add as a project to readthedocs.
Build and enjoy.


How does this work?

It's a mystery!
